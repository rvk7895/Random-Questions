1. Difference between Frameworks and Libraries

    A library is something which can be used in a project to solve specific tasks. Framework kind of provides a general skeleton to the project. It provides generic code which could be modified to accomplish a  specific task by the programmer.

    A key difference that arises between Framework and Library is the **Inversion of Control**. While a library can be called upon whenever the programmer deems appropriate but a framework generally requires that the programmer is immersed in its workflow meaning the programmer has to code in the general structure which is required for the framework. That's why its said that the framework is in control of development workflow.

    Another difference is normally Frameworks are built with extensibility in mind i.e. they provide the generic functionality needed for the application but leave room for application specific additions or even modifications. While this is not the case for libraries cause they are made in mind to solve specific problems only.
